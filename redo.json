The content was there but it wasn’t reading any of my css files. Maybe I didn’t had Tailwind CSS setup properly. When I previewed the built site locally it was fine, so maybe it was something else.</p>\n<p>I decided to start over. I found <a href=\"https://github.com/Glench/sveltekit-github-pages-template\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this template</a>, which links to <a href=\"https://sveltesaas.com/articles/sveltekit-github-pages-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>. When I copied it, it didn’t work - I think sveltekit had some changes very recently. I did like the “hack” of building into the <code>doc</code> directory rather than creating a gh-pages branch.</p>\n<p>I ran <code>npm init svelte@next</code> and built the demo app. Then I modified the <code>svelte.config.js</code> to use the static adapter. I removed the <code>target</code> and <code>paths</code> properties as well as the <code>/** @type {import(&#39;@sveltejs/kit&#39;).Config} */</code> link.</p>\n<p>I also added the <code>.nojekyll</code> file, and added a <code>CNAME</code> containing my custom domain: calendar.ihtfy.com. On the GitHub page, I went to Settings &gt; Pages, and then set the Source to master/docs. I also set the custom domain to calendar.ihtfy.com, and toggled on HTTPS.</p>\n<p>On the domain admin for ihtfy.com, I went to DNS settings and added a new CNAME record. The Host name is <code>calendar.ihtfy.com</code>, and the Data is <code>ihtfy.github.io.</code>.</p>\n<p>Now when I run <code>npm run build</code> in my terminal, it creates all the static assets (html, css, js) in the docs folder. Then when I push it to GitHub, it automatically deploys to <a href=\"https://calendar.ihtfy.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">calendar.ihtfy.com</a>.</p>\n<p>By the way, this site is still just the demo app with the colors and some links changed. Now that I have the demo site working, I may try adding Tailwind CSS again, but maybe not.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
