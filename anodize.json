I tried to anodize one using a blowtorch: a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3upUfSa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bernzomatic TS8000</a> that I bought to sear sous vide steaks.</p>\n<p>I was hoping to turn the paperclip a bluish color to match the logo. The paperclips are steel, and as you heat them, they change color permanently from silver to gold to purple to gray. This is because a layer of iron oxide is forming on the surface which creates wave phasing effects: the perceived wavelength of the light changes resulting in different colors, because some light reflects off the surface and some penetrates the oxide layer and reflects off the original surface.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/anodize/wave-interference.gif\" alt=\"mrtitanium.com\"></p>\n<p>This video from The Action Lab also explains it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zshXJyq-xcM\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zshXJyq-xcM/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"The Action Lab\"></a></p>\n<p>I thought that since the metal is so thin, it would be easy to evenly heat the whole piece to get a consistent color. It’s not so easy. The electrode method is much better I’m sure, but I was just playing around.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read","relatedPosts":[]}
