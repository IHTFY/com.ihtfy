You can see the current progress <a href=\"https://calendar.ihtfy.com/data\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. It’s still has a long way to go. I’ve been working on componentizing and getting image uploading to work. I originally tried using filepond as the image uploading component, but after a lot of issues, I realized that was better suited for uploading to a remote server. Now, I’m using a svelte version of <a href=\"https://github.com/thecodejack/svelte-file-dropzone\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dropzone</a>. It seems to work alright, although the css styling of the component gives me some trouble.</p>\n<p>I still need to get the loading and saving events worked out. Then I’m going to used indexedDB, or more likely dexie which is a wrapper for indexedDB. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IndexedDB</a> is like localStorage in the browser; it persists between sessions. It’s supposed to be better for larger data like images. For now, I’m still using base64 strings to store the images, but I may move to blobs, since indexedDB supports that too.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
