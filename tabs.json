{"slug":"tabs","title":"Tabs","date":"2022-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Adding navigation to Empire","tags":["code","gaming"],"html":"<p>I added some changes to my <a href=\"https://empire.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Empire</a> game; most noticeably, navigation tabs. I also added a button to peek at your secret nickname, and I added some color and avatars to the Lobby. Adding the tabs was actually a bit complicated since the logic flow of the game relied on it being impossible to go back and resubmit forms, etc.</p>\n<p>My family played over Christmas, and it worked pretty well. My sister said she played it again with her in-laws, and they had fun too. Hopefully everyone will enjoy the little improvements I made.</p>\n<p>The whole game could use a visual makeover, namely a consistent color palette. There’s also a glitch when going to the 2nd tab on mobile: the client size gets larger than the screen/html/body. Clicking the share link fixes one of the overflow directions, and going to another tab and back eliminates it. I think it may be an issue with <a href=\"https://materializecss.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">materializeCSS</a>, but I’m not sure.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-block info svelte-sw7wss\"><div class=\"icon-wrapper svelte-sw7wss\"><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M12 11.5V16.5\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path><path d=\"M12 7.51L12.01 7.49889\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path><path d=\"M12 22C17.5228 22 22 17.5228 22 12C22 6.47715 17.5228 2 12 2C6.47715 2 2 6.47715 2 12C2 17.5228 6.47715 22 12 22Z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path></svg></div>\n\t2022-01-09\n<p>I noticed the label was extending past the edge of the screen. I think there’s an issue calculating its size since it has a transition. I just hid the overflow on the parent element - <code>.input-field</code></p>\n</div>\n<p>I started making the site years ago, before I was comfortable using a framework or even npm packages.

I guess the daily aspect makes people burnout slower, and it promotes sharing with friends since everyone sees the same word - like a daily puzzle on lichess or chess.com. Also, what else can you do while waiting for another word?</p>\n<p>It would be simple to expand the game to use words of different lengths, or have categories of words, or allow unlimited guesses and accumulate an aggregated score for X number of rounds.</p>\n<p>I might make my own version of the game with extra options for fun.</p>\n<p>The “share” text is also unique. It uses emojis to represent how well you did: black boxes for wrong letters, yellow for wrong position, and green for correct placement. This let’s people share their game in a cryptic way, which makes people search for “Wordle” to figure out what ot means.</p>\n<p>I know it started to go viral on tiktok a few weeks ago. Largely, people were sharing strategies, and some people were looking at the code of the game to find the list of target and guess words.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read"},{"slug":"pwa","title":"PWA","date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Making the Knight Puzzle a PWA","tags":["code","gaming"],"html":"<p>I converted the <a href=\"https://knightpuzzle.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight Puzzle</a> to a PWA.
