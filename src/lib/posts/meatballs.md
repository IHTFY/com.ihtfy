I just had an idea for dinner tonight.

We have a giant bag of meatballs from Costco. I often have them as a snack - mixed with some homemade barbecue sauce. I also have a jar of tikka masala. I think that might make a good sauce. Oh, I just remembered it's Ash Wednesday, so I can't eat meatballs. Maybe tomorrow.
