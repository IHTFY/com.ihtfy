I'm thinking about ending the daily posts at the end of the month and transitioning to weekly instead.

I also want to focus on making videos rather than written posts. I'd like the blog to be supplemental to the videos - contain extra details.

It's true I've had plenty of time to make videos even with a daily blog, but I think it will help to make the shift in focus more explicit.

I will commit myself to making weekly videos starting in April.
