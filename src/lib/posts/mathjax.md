# Math on GitHub

I was looking at my [mandelbrot project](https://github.com/IHTFY/mandelbrot), and I was wondering if I could better format the math. After googling around, I found a few hacks: open APIs to generate SVG or PNG math images, a hack to use Jupyter notebook on github, and some other stuff.

Looking through some old GitHub supoprt tickets, they kept saying it's not supported. But just 5 days ago, [they finally added it](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/).

It's nice that they added that.

# Where were you?

Also, I realize I've totally failed on my daily posts, as well as weekly posts, and weekly videos. I've been going to the gym regularly at least.

I was able to get ihtfy.com approved for google adsense, so I may add ads to some of my projects at some point.

I do still plan on making YouTube videos.

I'm realizing as I write this post, it's not quite as simple to create a posts as the WordPress setup. Writing in markdown is fine, but manually creating the appropriate file structure, asset folder, optimized images, is a bit of a pain. But I do like that I can customize everything and even include scripts and other packages if I want.
