excerpt: How I made the thumbnails for these posts.

I've been using [this site](https://app.wombo.art/) to make the thumbnail images for these posts - using the title as the prompt.

The last two days, I forgot to write until just after midnight. I adjusted the post date to be 11:59pm just to keep the dates consistent, but I failed to adhere to the original goal. I think I will move to the weekly posts, and just update the draft throughout the week. This should mean there are no more totally junk posts like the last two days.

Once I migrate to my new site - by June 21, 2022 - I may consolidate these last 3 months of daily posts.
