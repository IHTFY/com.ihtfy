I just ordered a Chick-fil-A Cow PEZ dispenser. I'm going to see if I can fill it with Lactaid pills. I've just been slipping the individually wrapped ones into my wallet, but they're a bit bulky, and I run out quickly. A while back I bought a fake key fob with a compartment, but it's difficult to open. Hopefully they fit; I'm worried about the thickness of the pill not matching a PEZ, but I'll find out soon.
