The goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens are attacking each other. It’s pretty tricky. Eight also happens to be the maximum number. It’s clear we cannot place nine, because each queen must occupy a private column and row.</p>\n<p>This puzzle can be generalized to any of the other pieces. Pawns are a bit funny, because they are the only piece whose movement depends on the board orientation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"game-modes\">Game Modes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#game-modes\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I call this “Non-Attacking” mode, and the goal is to place as many of a given piece type without any pieces attacking each other.

I guess the daily aspect makes people burnout slower, and it promotes sharing with friends since everyone sees the same word - like a daily puzzle on lichess or chess.com. Also, what else can you do while waiting for another word?</p>\n<p>It would be simple to expand the game to use words of different lengths, or have categories of words, or allow unlimited guesses and accumulate an aggregated score for X number of rounds.</p>\n<p>I might make my own version of the game with extra options for fun.</p>\n<p>The “share” text is also unique. It uses emojis to represent how well you did: black boxes for wrong letters, yellow for wrong position, and green for correct placement. This let’s people share their game in a cryptic way, which makes people search for “Wordle” to figure out what ot means.</p>\n<p>I know it started to go viral on tiktok a few weeks ago. Largely, people were sharing strategies, and some people were looking at the code of the game to find the list of target and guess words.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read"},{"slug":"pwa","title":"PWA","date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Making the Knight Puzzle a PWA","tags":["code","gaming"],"html":"<p>I converted the <a href=\"https://knightpuzzle.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight Puzzle</a> to a PWA.
