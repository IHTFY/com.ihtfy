I wanted to post something on January 1st and hopefully every day this year.

I’d like to have some of them be a series, like an educational course. I’d like to create a schedule to which I can adhere. I’d like to document the creation process of video/code/music/etc projects. I’d like to organize and display some of the work I’ve already done. I’d like to make money from this endeavor - any amount that scales with reach.</p>\n<p>Those are some ideas I came up with just now. My little sister, Ana, gave me a planner for Christmas last year that I didn’t fully utilize. I’ll try using that to keep me on track, too.</p>\n<p>My brother wants to fly my drone tomorrow, so maybe we’ll do that and I’ll have some things to share.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
