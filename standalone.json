Some of the difficulty came from forgetting to either clear the browser cache or restart the dev server. But in the end I got it working.</p>\n<p>I disabled overscrolling (pull to refresh/forward/backward) since that can mess up the game. I decided to keep zooming enabled for now. In the future I may try to conditionally allow navigation if in the browser versus in the PWA.</p>\n<p>I noticed that different mobile browsers handle the PWA differently, namely the color of the status bar, the background color of the icon when the app is sleeping. If you install via Brave it doesn’t install through the Play Store, so there is a browser icon in the corner of the app shortcut. Also, the Play Store version doesn’t acknowledge the Brave version and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Below are screenshots of the Empire PWA installed from Chrome, Brave, and Samsung Internet, respectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"app-icons\">App Icons<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#app-icons\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/standalone/20220109_213508.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/standalone/20220109_213508.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/standalone/20220109_213508.png\" alt=\"Brave shows a badge on the app icon\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n\t\n\t\t<figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Brave shows a badge on the app icon<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"opening-app\">Opening App<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#opening-app\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Only Chrome shows the theme color in the status bar.

I guess the daily aspect makes people burnout slower, and it promotes sharing with friends since everyone sees the same word - like a daily puzzle on lichess or chess.com. Also, what else can you do while waiting for another word?</p>\n<p>It would be simple to expand the game to use words of different lengths, or have categories of words, or allow unlimited guesses and accumulate an aggregated score for X number of rounds.</p>\n<p>I might make my own version of the game with extra options for fun.</p>\n<p>The “share” text is also unique. It uses emojis to represent how well you did: black boxes for wrong letters, yellow for wrong position, and green for correct placement. This let’s people share their game in a cryptic way, which makes people search for “Wordle” to figure out what ot means.</p>\n<p>I know it started to go viral on tiktok a few weeks ago. Largely, people were sharing strategies, and some people were looking at the code of the game to find the list of target and guess words.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read"},{"slug":"pwa","title":"PWA","date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Making the Knight Puzzle a PWA","tags":["code","gaming"],"html":"<p>I converted the <a href=\"https://knightpuzzle.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight Puzzle</a> to a PWA.
