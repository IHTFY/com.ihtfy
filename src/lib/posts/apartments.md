I've been looking at apartments. I found one that looked pretty good. Some of the neighbors houses were a bit questionable, but I ended up applying anyway. I had tried to check the crime rate in the neighborhood when I was there to tour, but my phone data wasn't loading. I found out in the morning from my girlfriend's coworker that it's the worst part of the worst street in the city. I guess I'll keep hunting.
