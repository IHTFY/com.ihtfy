I'm writing this on my phone again, which means this is a low quality post.

I went to the gym today for the first time in a while. It seems like I've finally learned my lesson to take it easy the first few times after a long break. I used to push too hard then get nearly bedridden for two days.

I gave myself a haircut yesterday. It turned out pretty well.
