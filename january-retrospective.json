The quality has not been consistent, but I would count this as a success so far. My website doesn’t get much traffic, and it’s not polluting emails or notifications, so I think it’s a nice place to have passive public accountability.</p>\n<p>In February, I’d like to have more high quality posts. I would be okay with a few “bye” days, but hopefully I can promote some mid-tier days to high-tier. If I resign from doing daily posts, I will eliminate the throwaway days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-frequent-youtube-videos\">Post frequent YouTube videos<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#post-frequent-youtube-videos\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I’ve only posted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obydiUba5ow\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 public video</a>. There were a few unlisted videos from earlier this month: <a href=\"/winter-drone/\">Drone</a>, <a href=\"/hibachi/\">Hibachi</a>. Public videos was what I cared about. At some point, I may move some videos to unlisted playlists and but keep the playlists public on my channel.</p>\n<p>In February, I’d like to have at least 2 new public-worthy videos. Ultimately, I’d like to grow an audience on YouTube, so I’d like to keep the content on that channel above the threshold for daily posts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-a-schedule\">Create a schedule<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#create-a-schedule\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t create a schedule. I’m glad I did post something everyday; it made me think I could condense several day’s ideas into nicer sized chunks. I think I will do reviews on the last day of each month. Perhaps there could be a weekly version too. Maybe next year I’ll only make weekly and monthly posts, but maybe I’ll keep daily private notes which I’ll condense into a weekly post.</p>\n<p>In February, I’ll spend some time in the morning thinking of what I can finish by the end of the day. Many days this month, it would be 10pm and I wouldn’t have anything to share. I’m not sure about differentiating days, yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"document-the-creation-of-various-projects\">Document the creation of various projects<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#document-the-creation-of-various-projects\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>My video about <a href=\"/logo/\">making a new logo</a> was kind of what I was thinking when I made this goal. That video in particular was unscripted and basically unedited - just a concatenation of clips. I also rushed the end, because I stopped recording my thought process. I have found that the videos I finished were all done in 1-2 days. I have project files that are much older, but I just keep pecking at them every few months.</p>\n<p>In February, I’d like to bring one of my long-term projects to completion and post about the steps I’m taking to finish it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organize-and-display-past-projects\">Organize and display past projects<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#organize-and-display-past-projects\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I haven’t focused on my past projects this month. I did go back to make some improvements on some of my web games which was good: <a href=\"/tabs/\">adding tabs to empire</a> and <a href=\"/standalone/\">making it an installable app</a>, also with <a href=\"/offline/\">Optics</a> and my <a href=\"/pwa/\">knight puzzle</a>, and adding some brains to my <a href=\"/chess-engine/\">chess engine</a>. Actually, I guess I did alright in this category.</p>\n<p>In February, I’d like to show my Vigenère cipher cracker I made a long time ago. I’d also like to check what other old code I have that might be interesting. This is mostly reducing regret; it would be sad if my old work died with me, even if it isn’t groundbreaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-money\">Make money<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#make-money\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I haven’t made any money from these projects this month. I will prioritize this more once I have a body of work I’m proud of and have a clear plan about future projects that people would be interested in funding.</p>\n<p>In February, I’ll make some categories on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/IHTFY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a>.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"4 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"february-retrospective","title":"February Retrospective","date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Reviewing my February goal progress","tags":["website","review"],"html":"<p>I forgot yesterday was the last day of February.</p>\n<p>My goals at the beginning of the month were:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’d like to have more high quality posts.
