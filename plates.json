I didn’t want to drill into the front bumper, so I bought <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BczzhP\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this license plate mount</a> that attaches to the tow mount. I was a little worried, because the reviews were mixed about whether it actually fits. I figured, some people were able to make it work, so it’s probably other people being dense, or maybe they had defective units.</p>\n<p>It came triple bagged.

Since I was missing a lock washer, I put the lock washer behind the plate. I was debating which whether to put it in front or behind, but when I was holding the assembly, it freely slipped from front back, so I don’t think it really matters.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/plates/installed.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/plates/installed.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/plates/installed.png\" alt=\"installed\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n\t\n\t\t<figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->installed<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<p>It turns out the missing nut didn’t matter much either, because it was too tight to reach behind the top left corner.

I didn’t do this, since it might make it too hard to remove the assembly from the mount incase the car ever needs a tow. I just used the included baby Allen wrench and tightened it until I felt like the screw was close to stripping. It felt pretty secure when I wiggled the plate with my hand, but we’ll see if it starts to sag.</p>\n<p>Also the cat from <a href=\"https://site.ihtfy.comm/cat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the other day</a> kept snuggling up to me while I was trying to install it.</p>","css":{"code":"picture.svelte-1gy5t1o.svelte-1gy5t1o{position:relative;width:100%;height:100%}picture.svelte-1gy5t1o img.svelte-1gy5t1o{width:100%;height:100%}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"3 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
