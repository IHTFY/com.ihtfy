A few things it’s missing are dark mode and grid/layout utilities.</p>\n<p>You can use SASS to override the default styles of components, but it doesn’t quite work. For example, the <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/tabs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tabs</a> colors can be modified using the <code>$main</code>, <code>$disabled</code>, and <code>$off-state</code> variables, but you can’t make it pure black. When I set it, the final computed style is a medium grey, so I can’t get the active tab to be brighter than the inactive ones using my dark theme.</p>\n<p>There aren’t any column/row/grid components, so I’ve been doing it manually. Maybe I could use some other library. It seems like there’s no margin on a lot of elements, e.g. buttons and form elements.</p>\n<p>I thought I could use the Table element to display the Events (holidays/birthdays), but the table only accepts and displays text data. I decided to make another function that finds the table and replaces the last column of text with an <code>img</code> element whose <code>src</code> is the text. This seems to work fine, but maybe I should just have a custom Element that displays the info in a nice container and then stack those items in a flex column. This may make it easier to add click listeners to each event as well.</p>\n<p>There was an issue I was having with the dropzone. The box was resizing to the shape of the inner text, which was very short if the wrong image type was dragged. If you hovered over the edge of the dropzone, the box would show the error and shrink the size. But then your mouse wasn’t hovering anymore, so it would grow to full size again. Then it would show the error and shrink, etc.</p>\n<p>It turns out it was because I was using <code>display: flex</code> on most of my elements in the form, including the dropzone. I made a wrapper for the dropzone and set it to <code>display: block</code> instead which fixed it.</p>\n<p>Also, there aren’t many options for changing the CSS of the Attractions components other than color. There’s some border radius, but not much size stuff. I’m thinking I may go back to Bulma on future projects.</p>\n<p>I’ve uploaded the new version to <a href=\"https://cmaker.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cmaker.ihtfy.com</a>.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"studio","title":"Studio","date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I own calendar.studio","tags":["code","project"],"html":"<p>I guess Google domains was in beta, but they’re out of it now.

The changes I want to make are:</p>\n<p>From Matt:</p>\n<ul><li>Have featured images in posts (display when on All Posts /posts)</li>\n<li>Have different sized post tiles, but all small on mobile</li>\n<li>Add hover animation (enlarging) to post tiles</li>\n<li>Add options to display filename and language on code</li>\n<li>Tweak colors for more contrast</li>\n<li>Add SVG animations</li>\n<li>Maybe use scrollTo/scrollIntoView during page navigation</li>\n<li>Maybe use image optimization</li></ul>\n<p>I’ll also need to format my exported WordPress data to match. I noticed both site store the images in the static folder, then reference the image using either the post slug or explicitly writing it. I’ll try to use the slug, like Matt. This is going to take a while.</p>\n<p>Actually, I’m going to leave that alone for now. I just realized Matt’s site uses Jekyll, and I’m not sure how integrated that is (Edit: No, his old site used it). I’ll just take styling points from there for now rather than site structure.</p>\n<p>I reran the wordpress-export-to-markdown script to get rid of the date prefixes on each folder. I’ll also use the <code>.svx</code> extension rather than <code>.md</code>. I tried copy/pasting the contents of one of my .md into an existing .svx post and it seems to work. I’ll need to sort out links to assets though; maybe I can do a regex replace on the whole project.</p>\n<p>I tried doing dynamic routing with <code>[slug]</code> again but it didn’t work. I think the error using <code>dev</code> with Matt’s site might be related, so unless I get that working it probably doesn’t make sense to use that as a guide for implementing it in Elianiva’s site.</p>\n<p>Using Windows shell, I ran</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-1w2kx1p\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-1w2kx1p\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> /R %x <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\"></span>*.md<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span> ren <span class=\"token string\">\"%x\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\"></span>*.svx</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>to rename all the markdown files.</p>\n<p>I also noticed each post needs to have tags. It’s probably worth adding them.</p>\n<p>I was able to to a regex replace by folder.</p>\n<p>I need to restructure the images - I’m doing it by hand. I’ll also need to change the links to wordpress assets accordingly. Probably by hand again. I have 62 posts, so it’s not too bad; they don’t all have pictures either.</p>\n<p>Okay, did a bunch of moving/renaming/deleting files and links in posts. Not done yet, but it builds. <a href=\"https://blog.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> for now.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure why, but adding smooth scroll breaks navigation. Maybe something with lazy loading components? Or more likely the fading transition.</p>","css":{"code":".code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p.svelte-1w2kx1p{display:block;position:relative;background-color:var(--code-background-color);color:var(--code-text-color);font-family:var(--mono-font);font-size:1rem;line-height:1.33em;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:var(--shadow);padding:30px 15px;margin:30px 0}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p pre{overflow-x:auto;scrollbar-color:var(--primary-color) var(--scrollbar-track-color);scrollbar-width:thin;padding-bottom:5px}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p pre::-webkit-scrollbar{height:8px}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{background:var(--primary-color)}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover{background:var(--primary-light-color)}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p .lang.svelte-1w2kx1p{position:absolute;right:0;top:-15px;background:inherit;border-radius:8px;padding:5px 10px;z-index:2;font-size:0.85em}.code-block.svelte-1w2kx1p .filename.svelte-1w2kx1p{background:inherit;border-top-left-radius:8px;border-top-right-radius:8px;margin-bottom:-2px;padding:5px 10px;position:absolute;left:0px;top:-15px;z-index:1}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"3 min read"},{"slug":"another","title":"Another","date":"2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Redesigning my website","tags":["code","website","design"],"html":"<p>I’m still stuck on the MDSveX/prismjs error. I found <a href=\"https://github.com/elianiva/elianiva.my.id\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another site</a> that uses sveltekit. It’s hosted on vercel, but I wonder if it will work if I just change the adapter to static in <code>svelte.convig.js</code>.</p>\n<p>That worked. I think I’ll use this as a starting point for now.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. Same kind of problem, but showing different errors. When I open a blog it gives an error. But if I refresh, I can navigate back and forth and see all posts without problem.</p>\n<p>So, if I refresh I can’t go to a post the first time. Actually, now it’s not working at all. And now it’s working completely. I don’t know what’s happening - maybe browser caching something? Seems to work now, so I’ll move forward.</p>\n<p>I’m going to see if I can host this page on GitHub with a custom url. I’ve had problems with routing before, so I think it’s worth testing early. I’ll install <code>gh-pages</code> to my developer dependencies using:</p>\n<p><code>npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code></p>\n<p>And I’ll add a script to <code>package.json</code> called <code>deploy</code> that runs:</p>\n<p><code>gh-pages -d build</code></p>\n<p>Now, let’s see if it will host on the default GitHub url. I think I need to check in the whole repository first, because I don’t think gh-pages will create a new one.</p>\n<p>It’s mostly working now, but it’s looking for assets in BASEURL/… vs BASEURL/REPONAME?…, but I think that means it will work if I just use ihtfy.com or even a subdomain like blog.ihtfy.com.</p>\n<p>It’s not working, but I forgot to add a <code>.nojekyll</code> file to the root. I’ll add it in the <code>/static</code> directory and rebuild. Apparently, Jekyll doesn’t post files or directories that start with an underscore.</p>\n<p>GitHub or gh-pages keeps deleting my <code>.nojekyll</code> file. I tried adding some test inside, but that didn’t help. I have to manually add the file back in through GitHub.</p>\n<p>If I open the site in a private window, it doesn’t load the css. If I then hard refresh, it works. But if I do a normal refresh it doesn’t. Ah, just saw that I had another browser window open so the private session never ended. The refresh stuff is gone now.</p>\n<p>I just tried the old starter project again and noticed the build preview is working, but not the dev. Who knows…</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparison\">Comparison<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#comparison\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>There are some things I like from the different sites.</p>\n<p>From Matt’s:</p>\n<ul><li>SVG animations - Background and logo</li>\n<li>Hover animation on posts (but they’re not on the other cards)</li>\n<li>Smooth scrolling</li>\n<li>Code can show filename and language</li>\n<li>Custom highlighting (sparkle wrapper and brush stroke)</li>\n<li>Featured image for posts</li>\n<li>Different shaped tiling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fantinel.dev/web-images-modern-formats/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Image optimization</a></li></ul>\n<p>From Elianiva’s:</p>\n<ul><li>Link/page hover animation</li>\n<li>Dark mode switch (Matt’s is automatic, but I like the option)</li>\n<li>Fading transition between pages (doesn’t work as well on mobile - flashes)</li>\n<li>Scrollbar styling</li>\n<li>Scroll to top button</li>\n<li>Color scheme, but needs more contrast on homepage post elements</li>\n<li>Search in posts with live updating</li>\n<li>Semi-sticky header with animations and mobile reactivity (Matt’s mobile nav loses the links)</li>\n<li>Info bubbles can have header info: date and title</li></ul>\n<p>Matt’s site gives errors on dev, but build works.

The sticky header might be a little tricky but not sure. Scroll to top isn’t bad, and I think the fading is an option provided by Svelte, but not sure. Huh, they both have smooth-scrolling; maybe I just noticed it on Matt’s because it scrolls to points on the page.</p>\n<p>If GitHub stops auto deleting my <code>.nojekyll</code> that would be nice. I just deployed again, and it seems to be sticking now.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"4 min read"}]}
