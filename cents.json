I recall at one point the rule of thumb was 1,000 views ≈ $1, but that could vary ± an order of magnitude. I’ve paid for YouTube Premium for a while, so I don’t see ads. I don’t enjoy watching them, but I’m not totally opposed to them. I guess there’s a balance of how much I like the content, how annoying the ads are, and how much disposable income I have.</p>\n<p>I don’t like having ads on my website; I think they make it look “scammy”. Plus I’m paying to host it, and it makes it look worse. Maybe if I could make hundreds of dollars by having a few boxes of content on the side, but that’s not really happening.</p>\n<p>I know I made a resolution to make 2 videos this month, and time is getting low - only a week left.
