The goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens are attacking each other. It’s pretty tricky. Eight also happens to be the maximum number. It’s clear we cannot place nine, because each queen must occupy a private column and row.</p>\n<p>This puzzle can be generalized to any of the other pieces.
