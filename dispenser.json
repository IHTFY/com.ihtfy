I’m going to see if I can fill it with Lactaid pills. I’ve just been slipping the individually wrapped ones into my wallet, but they’re a bit bulky, and I run out quickly. A while back I bought a fake key fob with a compartment, but it’s difficult to open. Hopefully they fit; I’m worried about the thickness of the pill not matching a PEZ, but I’ll find out soon.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"battery","title":"Battery","date":"2022-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I updated my drone batteries.","tags":["photography","random"],"html":"<h1 id=\"drone-update\">Drone Update<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#drone-update\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>In my <a href=\"/winter-drone\">Winter Drone</a> post from the beginning of the year, I mentioned that I was having trouble updating my drone batteries’ firmware. I booted up the drone today, and was able to update the app and firmware straightforwardly. Another problem that solved itself through procrastination.</p>\n<p>It’s strange how sometimes procrastination pays off.</p>\n<p>I also learned that the batteries are designed to drain to storage capacity (30% or something) after 10 days. That means I should only charge them immediately before flying.</p>\n<h1 id=\"videos\">Videos<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#videos\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>I still haven’t made any videos. I was working on making <a href=\"https://domination.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a site</a> to play the Eight Queens Puzzle and the equivalents for the other pieces. You can also play the companion problem; the original is to place the maximum number of non-attacking pieces, but you can also try to place the minimum number of pieces to occupy or attack all squares.</p>\n<p>There are still some features I could implement:</p>\n<ul><li>Highlight covered squares on hover</li>\n<li>Highlight uncovered squares in Domination mode</li>\n<li>Highlight attacking pieces in Non-Attacking mode</li>\n<li>Save scores in local storage</li>\n<li>Show the differential between current, personal best, and best possible</li>\n<li>Generate all possible solutions (I’ve done this for some but not all)</li></ul>\n<p>I’d like to prioritize making the video, though.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ads\">Ads<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#ads\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>I added Google AdSense ads to most of my project sites. I opted to only use “anchor” ads - the kind that slide in from the top or bottom and and be collapsed. I find these to be the least invasive kind, since they’re dismissable. I will probably remove these at some point, because I don’t think they will ever generate substantial revenue.</p>\n<p>I haven’t promoted any of my sites other than posting on this blog and word of mouth. I suppose a YouTube video could lead some people there. I’ll leave them for now and see.</p>\n<p>The ads are designed for multi-page sites and not apps or single page sites. I’ll only get 1 impression per visit, even if the person clicks and navigates all over the app for hours. Also, the ads on <a href=\"https://empire.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Empire</a> almost never get fulfilled. I think it has to do with the css or something - maybe the navbar or sidebar. I tried commenting out components, but I couldn’t get it working reliably.</p>\n<h1 id=\"hosts\">Hosts<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#hosts\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>To test out Google Ads when running a local dev server, I edit my hosts file. On Windows, it’s at <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts</code>. I add <code>127.0.0.1 empire.ihtfy.com</code> to the bottom. And then when I start the server, I just go to <code>empire.ihtfy.com</code>. I can’t remember if I have to add the port - I think I do, but only in the address bar in the browser - the host file is definitely just the base url and ip address.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"3 min read"},{"slug":"again","title":"Again","date":"2022-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I forgot to write again","tags":["random"],"html":"<p>I forgot to write again.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read"},{"slug":"oops","title":"Oops","date":"2022-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I missed a day.","tags":["random"],"html":"<p>I forgot to write today</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read"}]}
