The “Best” is what I think the optimal length is.

I guess the daily aspect makes people burnout slower, and it promotes sharing with friends since everyone sees the same word - like a daily puzzle on lichess or chess.com. Also, what else can you do while waiting for another word?</p>\n<p>It would be simple to expand the game to use words of different lengths, or have categories of words, or allow unlimited guesses and accumulate an aggregated score for X number of rounds.</p>\n<p>I might make my own version of the game with extra options for fun.</p>\n<p>The “share” text is also unique. It uses emojis to represent how well you did: black boxes for wrong letters, yellow for wrong position, and green for correct placement. This let’s people share their game in a cryptic way, which makes people search for “Wordle” to figure out what ot means.</p>\n<p>I know it started to go viral on tiktok a few weeks ago. Largely, people were sharing strategies, and some people were looking at the code of the game to find the list of target and guess words.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read"},{"slug":"pwa","title":"PWA","date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Making the Knight Puzzle a PWA","tags":["code","gaming"],"html":"<p>I converted the <a href=\"https://knightpuzzle.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight Puzzle</a> to a PWA.
