I've seen a couple videos of people putting frozen cheese pizza upside-down in the oven.

[Here's the latest one](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTd5wRqjK/)

I did this once, making a pizza for my little sister. I never get pizza without toppings, so I wasn't used to seeing a plain on both sides.

I think it was Home Run Inn brand.
