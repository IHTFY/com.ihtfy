{"slug":"another","title":"another","date":"2022-02-24","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I’m still stuck on the MDSveX/prismjs error. I found <a href=\"https://github.com/elianiva/elianiva.my.id\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another site</a> that uses sveltekit. It’s hosted on vercel, but I wonder if it will work if I just change the adapter to static in <code>svelte.convig.js</code>.</p>\n<p>That worked. I think I’ll use this as a starting point for now.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. Same kind of problem, but showing different errors. When I open a blog it gives an error. But if I refresh, I can navigate back and forth and see all posts without problem.</p>\n<p>So, if I refresh I can’t go to a post the first time. Actually, now it’s not working at all. And now it’s working completely. I don’t know what’s happening - maybe browser caching something? Seems to work now, so I’ll move forward.</p>\n<p>I’m going to see if I can host this page on GitHub with a custom url. I’ve had problems with routing before, so I think it’s worth testing early. I’ll install <code>gh-pages</code> to my developer dependencies using:</p>\n<p><code>npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code></p>\n<p>And I’ll add a script to <code>package.json</code> called <code>deploy</code> that runs:</p>\n<p><code>gh-pages -d build</code></p>\n<p>Now, let’s see if it will host on the default GitHub url. I think I need to check in the whole repository first, because I don’t think gh-pages will create a new one.</p>\n<p>It’s mostly working now, but it’s looking for assets in BASEURL/… vs BASEURL/REPONAME?…, but I think that means it will work if I just use ihtfy.com or even a subdomain like blog.ihtfy.com.</p>\n<p>It’s not working, but I forgot to add a <code>.nojekyll</code> file to the root. I’ll add it in the <code>/static</code> directory and rebuild. Apparently, Jekyll doesn’t post files or directories that start with an underscore.</p>\n<p>GitHub or gh-pages keeps deleting my <code>.nojekyll</code> file. I tried adding some test inside, but that didn’t help. I have to manually add the file back in through GitHub.</p>\n<p>If I open the site in a private window, it doesn’t load the css. If I then hard refresh, it works. But if I do a normal refresh it doesn’t. Ah, just saw that I had another browser window open so the private session never ended. The refresh stuff is gone now.</p>\n<p>I just tried the old starter project again and noticed the build preview is working, but not the dev. Who knows…</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparison\">Comparison<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#comparison\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>There are some things I like from the different sites.</p>\n<p>From Matt’s:</p>\n<ul><li>SVG animations - Background and logo</li>\n<li>Hover animation on posts (but they’re not on the other cards)</li>\n<li>Smooth scrolling</li>\n<li>Code can show filename and language</li>\n<li>Custom highlighting (sparkle wrapper and brush stroke)</li>\n<li>Featured image for posts</li>\n<li>Different shaped tiling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fantinel.dev/web-images-modern-formats/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Image optimization</a></li></ul>\n<p>From Elianiva’s:</p>\n<ul><li>Link/page hover animation</li>\n<li>Dark mode switch (Matt’s is automatic, but I like the option)</li>\n<li>Fading transition between pages (doesn’t work as well on mobile - flashes)</li>\n<li>Scrollbar styling</li>\n<li>Scroll to top button</li>\n<li>Color scheme, but needs more contrast on homepage post elements</li>\n<li>Search in posts with live updating</li>\n<li>Semi-sticky header with animations and mobile reactivity (Matt’s mobile nav loses the links)</li>\n<li>Info bubbles can have header info: date and title</li></ul>\n<p>Matt’s site gives errors on dev, but build works. I’m not sure if I can work with that though. I think I may start with the Elianiva site and add component styling ideas from Matt.</p>\n<ul><li>SVG animations I’ll make on my own</li>\n<li>Hover animations on posts shouldn’t be too hard</li>\n<li>Smooth scrolling I think is just a CSS attribute on html, then maybe some logic to setting scroll points when navigating to different pages, i.e. backwards</li>\n<li>I think I can add filename and language info pretty easily, but maybe it depends on the highlighter or markdown preprocessor, but both use MDSveX.</li>\n<li>I’ll make my own highlighting classes</li>\n<li>I don’t think adding images to posts will be difficult, but making them look nice might be</li>\n<li>I’ll have to see if the tile shapes are automatic and if they depend on the post contents</li></ul>\n<p>The search on Elianiva’s I would guess is just a library but seems a bit daunting. The sticky header might be a little tricky but not sure. Scroll to top isn’t bad, and I think the fading is an option provided by Svelte, but not sure. Huh, they both have smooth-scrolling; maybe I just noticed it on Matt’s because it scrolls to points on the page.</p>\n<p>If GitHub stops auto deleting my <code>.nojekyll</code> that would be nice. I just deployed again, and it seems to be sticking now.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"4 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
