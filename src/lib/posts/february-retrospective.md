I forgot yesterday was the last day of February.

My goals at the beginning of the month were:

> I’d like to have more high quality posts. I would be okay with a few “bye” days, but hopefully I can promote some mid-tier days to high-tier. If I resign from doing daily posts, I will eliminate the throwaway days.

<Callout type="success">Succeeded</Callout>

I had many less throw away days, and I had some decently in-depth posts.

> I’d like to have at least 2 new public-worthy videos. Ultimately, I’d like to grow an audience on YouTube, so I’d like to keep the content on that channel above the threshold for daily posts.

<Callout type="warning">Failed</Callout>

I didn't post any public videos. I did post [an unlisted video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPAhIPJNIDM).

> I’ll spend some time in the morning thinking of what I can finish by the end of the day. Many days this month, it would be 10pm and I wouldn’t have anything to share. I’m not sure about differentiating days, yet.

<Callout type="success">Succeeded</Callout>

Most days, I would think of an idea long before 10pm. I also started working ahead which gave me time to delve into longer posts, like [Compression](https://frankiemercado.com/2022/02/12/compression/) and [Pseudorandom](https://frankiemercado.com/2022/02/13/pseudorandom/).

> I’d like to bring one of my long-term projects to completion and post about the steps I’m taking to finish it.

<Callout type="warning">Failed</Callout>

I have spent a lot of time working on rebuilding my website, which is kind of finishing a long-term project. I didn't complete it, so I think this is a failure. Same with the calendar maker; I worked on it but didn't finish. I did make [Vortex](https://vortex.ihtfy.com/) pretty quickly though.

> I’d like to show my Vigenère cipher cracker I made a long time ago. I’d also like to check what other old code I have that might be interesting. This is mostly reducing regret; it would be sad if my old work died with me, even if it isn’t groundbreaking.

<Callout type="success">Succeeded</Callout>

A few posts were showcasing code I had written a long time ago: [SoundCloud Likes](https://frankiemercado.com/2022/02/02/soundcloud-likes/), [Livestreams](https://frankiemercado.com/2022/02/03/livestreams/), [Shortner](https://frankiemercado.com/2022/02/07/shortner/).

> I'll make some categories on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/IHTFY).

<Callout type="warning">Failed</Callout>

No excuse really. It wouldn't take long, but I also recognize it's not going to get any use right now.
