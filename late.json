I booted up the drone today, and was able to update the app and firmware straightforwardly. Another problem that solved itself through procrastination.</p>\n<p>It’s strange how sometimes procrastination pays off.</p>\n<p>I also learned that the batteries are designed to drain to storage capacity (30% or something) after 10 days. That means I should only charge them immediately before flying.</p>\n<h1 id=\"videos\">Videos<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#videos\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>I still haven’t made any videos.

I opted to only use “anchor” ads - the kind that slide in from the top or bottom and and be collapsed. I find these to be the least invasive kind, since they’re dismissable. I will probably remove these at some point, because I don’t think they will ever generate substantial revenue.</p>\n<p>I haven’t promoted any of my sites other than posting on this blog and word of mouth. I suppose a YouTube video could lead some people there. I’ll leave them for now and see.</p>\n<p>The ads are designed for multi-page sites and not apps or single page sites. I’ll only get 1 impression per visit, even if the person clicks and navigates all over the app for hours. Also, the ads on <a href=\"https://empire.ihtfy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Empire</a> almost never get fulfilled. I think it has to do with the css or something - maybe the navbar or sidebar. I tried commenting out components, but I couldn’t get it working reliably.</p>\n<h1 id=\"hosts\">Hosts<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#hosts\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h1>\n<p>To test out Google Ads when running a local dev server, I edit my hosts file. On Windows, it’s at <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts</code>. I add <code>127.0.0.1 empire.ihtfy.com</code> to the bottom. And then when I start the server, I just go to <code>empire.ihtfy.com</code>. I can’t remember if I have to add the port - I think I do, but only in the address bar in the browser - the host file is definitely just the base url and ip address.</p>","css":{"code":".callout-block.svelte-sw7wss.svelte-sw7wss{--bg-color:var(--callout-background-color);--accent-color:transparent;margin:40px 0 30px;padding:25px 25px;border-top-right-radius:10px;border-bottom-right-radius:10px;background:var(--bg-color);color:var(--text-color);border-left:4px solid var(--accent-color);position:relative}.callout-block.svelte-sw7wss .icon-wrapper.svelte-sw7wss{position:absolute;width:50px;height:50px;top:0;left:0;transform:translate(calc(-50% - 1.5px), -50%);background:var(--page-background-color);padding:8px;border-radius:50%;fill:var(--accent-color);color:var(--accent-color)}.callout-block.info.svelte-sw7wss.svelte-sw7wss{--bg-color:var(--callout-info-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-info-accent-color)}.callout-block.warning.svelte-sw7wss.svelte-sw7wss{--bg-color:var(--callout-warning-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-warning-accent-color)}.callout-block.error.svelte-sw7wss.svelte-sw7wss{--bg-color:var(--callout-error-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-error-accent-color)}.callout-block.success.svelte-sw7wss.svelte-sw7wss{--bg-color:var(--callout-success-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-success-accent-color)}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"3 min read"},{"slug":"again","title":"Again","date":"2022-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I forgot to write again","tags":["random"],"html":"<p>I forgot to write again.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read"},{"slug":"oops","title":"Oops","date":"2022-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"I missed a day.","tags":["random"],"html":"<p>I forgot to write today</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"1 min read"}]}
