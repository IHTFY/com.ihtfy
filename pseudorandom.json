I decided to give each event (birthday, holiday, anniversary, etc.) a random id. Rather than just use <code>Math.random()</code>, I decided to try using the browser’s <code>Crypto</code> interface. There’s a nice function that generates a UUID (universally unique identifier): <code>window.crypto.randomUUID()</code>. The result looks something like this: <code>&#39;a1d803ce-822e-4d2d-a68f-16f85a5c1508&#39;</code>. This is a 128 bit label which means there are 2128 unique values - around 3.4x1038 or roughly a trillion times a trillion times a trillion.</p>\n<p>You can also generate random integers using <code>getRandomValues</code>, and following the format (replacing <code>ARRAY</code>): <code>crypto.getRandomValues(new ARRAY(1))[0]</code>. You can use any of the typed integer arrays in JavaScript.</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Array</th>\n<th>Number of Values</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Int8Array</td>\n<td>2⁸ = 256</td>\n<td>[-128, 127]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Int16Array</td>\n<td>2¹⁶ = 65,536</td>\n<td>[-32768, 32767]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Int32Array</td>\n<td>2³² = 4,294,967,296</td>\n<td>[-2147483648, 2147483647]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uint8Array</td>\n<td>2⁸ = 256</td>\n<td>[0, 255]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uint16Array</td>\n<td>2¹⁶ = 65,536</td>\n<td>[0, 65535]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uint32Array</td>\n<td>2³² = 4,294,967,296</td>\n<td>[0, 4294967295]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uint8ClampedArray</td>\n<td>2⁸ = 256</td>\n<td>[0, 255]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>BigInt64Array</td>\n<td>2⁶⁴ = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615</td>\n<td>[-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>BitUint64Array</td>\n<td>2⁶⁴ = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615</td>\n<td>[0, 18446744073709551615]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The only difference between Uint8Array and Uint8ClampedArray is that the if you try assign a number outside of the range [0, 255], the clamped array will round you up to 0 or down to 255. The Uint8Array will take loop over, so 256 becomes 0, and -1 becomes 255, etc. I don’t think this has an effect on the random output code above though.</p>\n<p>The “U” in the name stands for “unsigned”, meaning the numbers are non-negative. The signed versions have are just centered around zero, so there are an equal amount of negative and non-negative outcomes.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
