There's a new bug with the site. When I show more/all posts, it will still only show 3 until I refresh the browser. I'm not sure why the api call isn't working. I'd also like to use dynamic routing for the posts. Since I can run the dev for Matt's site, I may start working from there and meet in the middle. That might be a lot of redundant work though. I do like the smooth scroll between pages. We'll see.

It's probably best to start from scratch so that I can claim I built the site.
