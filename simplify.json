It looks pretty much the same, but the underlying svg is much smaller.</p>\n<p>I originally made the logo in Adobe Illustrator. I made the original path, then expanded it, then filled it in, then hid the original path. This left the svg with some unnecessary information.</p>\n<p>I wrote the new version by hand. It’s just a path with a stroke width and rounded joints and ends like you’d expect.</p>\n<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" viewBox=\"0 0 14 14\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path d=\"M4 2l8 5l0 6l-10-12l10 0l-10 12l0-6l8-5\" stroke=\"#21326D\" stroke-width=\"0.7\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" fill=\"none\"></path></svg>\n<p>The <code>viewBox</code> is like the canvas; it goes from (0, 0) to (14, 14). The actual path is a bit smaller, but I have to accommodate for the stroke width. I also gave some extra margin on the sides to make it a square, since I’m using this as a favicon and logo.</p>\n<p>It starts at the coordinate (4, 2), then draws a line segment that’s right 8 units and down 5 units. Then it goes straight down for 6 units, and so on.</p>\n<p>I used Illustrator to export the image as different sized PNGs - ranging from 16 to 2048 pixels wide.</p>\n<p>I tried to add the svg to this post, but WordPress doesn’t let me do that - very lame.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
