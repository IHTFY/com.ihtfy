I did an [unlisted stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QikZC9J3ZkQ) talking about Raven's Progressive Matrices. YouTube was telling me it wasn't getting enough data for a smooth stream, but the replay doesn't look too bad.

I'll probably keep this unlisted for now. I'll probably make a public video once there's a working prototype or finished project.

My laptop fan was running full blast the whole time. I think I had to disable hardware acceleration to get display capture to work on OBS.
