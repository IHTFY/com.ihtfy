excerpt: How to setup Google Home speakers in a new house.

I was having trouble setting up my Google home speakers with the new wifi. The only way to fix it was to factory reset the speaker using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7073477?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgoogle-home-max%2Cgoogle-nest-mini-nd-gen).

It took a lot longer to figure out than it should have. I thought I factory reset, and it was still failing. Apparently my finger slipped off the button right before the 15 seconds was up, so it didn't work the first time.
