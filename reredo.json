And it’s just a static page hosted on GitHub, so I don’t really need SvelteKit for server side rendering. I had also had some problems getting any component libraries to install. I think I’m going to start over again just using Svelte, and hopefully I can get this library called <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Attractions</a> to work.</p>\n<p>It has a nice <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/file-dropzone\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FileDropzone</a> component and <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/date-picker\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DatePicker</a>. I’ll probably just have the settings and data page be <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/tabs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tabs</a> or maybe <a href=\"https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/modal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Modals</a>.</p>\n<p>I think I’ll still use <a href=\"https://dexie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dexie</a>/<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">indexedDB</a> for storage.</p>\n<p>I’ve used <a href=\"http://materializecss.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MaterializeCSS</a> several times, and it’s a fast way to style a page built without any framework. It also has a <a href=\"https://materializecss.com/pickers.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Date Picker</a> component. The library has never been updated though, and there are a few bugs I’ve found while working with it. For example, long months have the last letters cut off; this is probably fixable with some simple CSS, but there’s little stuff like that all over, e.g. missing margins/padding in the header component.</p>\n<p>I’ve used <a href=\"https://bulma.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bulma</a> just once I think - on the <a href=\"https://frankiemercado.com/2021/03/15/knight/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight Puzzle</a>. I think it worked pretty well. I had trouble styling the table, because it requires <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SASS</a> to modify the default styles, and I was trying to keep things simply by just using the Bulma CDN. But Bulma seems to have a collection of extensions (I think made by random users) including a <a href=\"https://wikiki.github.io/components/calendar/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">calender</a>. Bulma has a default <a href=\"https://bulma.io/documentation/form/file/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">File Upload</a> component, but it doesn’t support drag and drop which is nice to have.</p>\n<p>I think Attractions looks sleek, and I think it has most of what I need.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"2 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"habit","title":"habit","date":"2022-04-02","excerpt":"TODO","tags":["todo"],"html":"<p>I still get reminders from the WordPress app to post everyday.
