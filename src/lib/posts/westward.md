## Flying

I took my redeye flight to California this morning. It was supposed to be a single plane with 3 stops, but we ended up having an unscheduled plane switch.

## Puzzle

I also got this puzzle for Christmas. Putting it together was harder than taking it apart. It took a lot of finesse. I wonder how fast the assembler is.
