I had a system update on my phone a few days ago. Since then I had gotten false alarm notifications every 5 minutes or so. I tried a lot of things to located the source but was unsuccessful. I tried restarting in safe mode and it seemed to stop. When I rebooted into normal mode, the vibrations seemed to stay away. The one downside is tha5 all of my widgets were deleted as well as one app shortcut for some reason.
